# Shot-Predictor
## ECE379K Final Project

In basketball, the ability of a player to effectively shoot the basketball typically comes down to the player’s shooting form. While the form of the best shooters tend to look different, they all typically use the same fundamentals. In our project, we will attempt to capture these fundamental aspects of a player’s shooting form and attempt to predict the outcome of a shot using these features. Research has been done on extracting features from a player’s movement to classify the action a player is performing (shooting, dribbling, etc.) [1], but we would like to focus our energy on feature extraction from the shooting motion using pose estimation [2], object detection [3], and possibly other methods to extract feature descriptors of a shot and attempt to identify it as a make or a miss.
