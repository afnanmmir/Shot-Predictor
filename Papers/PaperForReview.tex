\section{Problem Description}
\label{sec:intro}

In basketball, the ability of a player to effectively shoot the basketball typically comes down to the player’s shooting form. While the form of the best shooters tend to look different, they all typically use the same fundamentals. In our project, we will attempt to capture these fundamental aspects of a player’s shooting form and attempt to predict the outcome of a shot using these features. Research has been done on extracting features from a player’s movement to classify the action a player is performing (shooting, dribbling, etc.) [1], but we would like to focus our energy on feature extraction from the shooting motion using pose estimation [2], object detection [3], and possibly other methods to extract feature descriptors of a shot and attempt to identify it as a make or a miss.\\
\indent This problem is a particularly nontrivial application of pose estimation for two main reasons. The first being that there are multiple stages to
a basketball shot that need to be taken into account. From dipping the ball to waist level, to the motion of bringing the ball to eye level, to releasing the ball, each
plays a significant role in the outcome of a shot, so each stage needs to be taken into account. The second reason is the variability of the average shot. It can be argued that no two shots are identitical, when taking into account the speed of the shot
and different shooting forms. This will require us to develop a method of capturing all the motions of a shot in a way that is invariant to the shot's speed and overall form.

\subsection{Pose Estimation}

Pose Estimation is a critical topic in computer vision that will intersect with our goal of trying to accurately capture the motion and actions of a person taking a shot in basketball. Pose estimation, in the context of 2D videos of humans, is the problem of localizing anatomical keypoints or joints in a frame by frame video or image [2]. To fulfill our goal of predicting the outcome of a basketball shot, it will be critical to assess the form of a player who's taking a shot - where form can be decomposed into various classifications of joints in space. Pose estimation methods can be categorized into bottom-up or top-down methodologies. Bottom-up methodologies start by estimating keypoints and body joints first, and then these points are clustered to form poses. In contrast, 
top-down methodologies of pose estimation first run a person detector before decomposing each person into their respective body joints within detected bounding boxes [10]. Computational complexity is a major consideration for landmark pose estimation algorithms, and modern SOTA pose estimation algorithms deploy deep learning and CNNs to improve compuational overhead and speed [2]. We list some examples of prevalent and SOTA pose estimation models that have been employed and researched below.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Type style and fonts}

Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman may also be used.
If neither is available on your word processor, please use the font closest in
appearance to Times to which you have access.

MAIN TITLE.
Center the title $1\frac{3}{8}$ inches (3.49 cm) from the top edge of the first page.
The title should be in Times 14-point, boldface type.
Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs;
do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word).
Leave two blank lines after the title.

AUTHOR NAME(s) and AFFILIATION(s) are to be centered beneath the title
and printed in Times 12-point, non-boldface type.
This information is to be followed by two blank lines.

The ABSTRACT and MAIN TEXT are to be in a two-column format.

MAIN TEXT.
Type main text in 10-point Times, single-spaced.
Do NOT use double-spacing.
All paragraphs should be indented 1 pica (approx.~$\frac{1}{6}$ inch or 0.422 cm).
Make sure your text is fully justified---that is, flush left and flush right.
Please do not place any additional blank lines between paragraphs.

Figure and table captions should be 9-point Roman type as in \cref{fig:onecol,fig:short}.
Short captions should be centred.

\noindent Callouts should be 9-point Helvetica, non-boldface type.
Initially capitalize only the first word of section titles and first-, second-, and third-order headings.

FIRST-ORDER HEADINGS.
(For example, {\large \bf 1. Introduction}) should be Times 12-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, with one blank line before, and one blank line after.

SECOND-ORDER HEADINGS.
(For example, { \bf 1.1. Database elements}) should be Times 11-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, with one blank line before, and one after.
If you require a third-order heading (we discourage it), use 10-point Times, boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, preceded by one blank line, followed by a period and your text on the same line.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Footnotes}

Please use footnotes\footnote{This is what a footnote looks like.
It often distracts the reader from the main flow of the argument.} sparingly.
Indeed, try to avoid footnotes altogether and include necessary peripheral observations in the text (within parentheses, if you prefer, as in this sentence).
If you wish to use a footnote, place it at the bottom of the column on the page on which it is referenced.
Use Times 8-point type, single-spaced.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Cross-references}

For the benefit of author(s) and readers, please use the
{\small\begin{verbatim}
  \cref{...}
\end{verbatim}}  command for cross-referencing to figures, tables, equations, or sections.
This will automatically insert the appropriate label alongside the cross-reference as in this example:
\begin{quotation}
  To see how our method outperforms previous work, please see \cref{fig:onecol} and \cref{tab:example}.
  It is also possible to refer to multiple targets as once, \eg~to \cref{fig:onecol,fig:short-a}.
  You may also return to \cref{sec:formatting} or look at \cref{eq:also-important}.
\end{quotation}
If you do not wish to abbreviate the label, for example at the beginning of the sentence, you can use the
{\small\begin{verbatim}
  \Cref{...}
\end{verbatim}}
command. Here is an example:
\begin{quotation}
  \Cref{fig:onecol} is also quite important.
\end{quotation}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{References}

List and number all bibliographical references in 9-point Times, single-spaced, at the end of your paper.
When referenced in the text, enclose the citation number in square brackets, for
example~\cite{Authors14}.
Where appropriate, include page numbers and the name(s) of editors of referenced books.
When you cite multiple papers at once, please make sure that you cite them in numerical order like this \cite{Alpher02,Alpher03,Alpher05,Authors14b,Authors14}.
If you use the template as advised, this will be taken care of automatically.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{@{}lc@{}}
    \toprule
    Method & Frobnability \\
    \midrule
    Theirs & Frumpy \\
    Yours & Frobbly \\
    Ours & Makes one's heart Frob\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Results.   Ours is better.}
  \label{tab:example}
\end{table}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Illustrations, graphs, and photographs}

All graphics should be centered.
In \LaTeX, avoid using the \texttt{center} environment for this purpose, as this adds potentially unwanted whitespace.
Instead use
{\small\begin{verbatim}
  \centering
\end{verbatim}}
at the beginning of your figure.
Please ensure that any point you wish to make is resolvable in a printed copy of the paper.
Resize fonts in figures to match the font in the body text, and choose line widths that render effectively in print.
Readers (and reviewers), even of an electronic copy, may choose to print your paper in order to read it.
You cannot insist that they do otherwise, and therefore must not assume that they can zoom in to see tiny details on a graphic.

When placing figures in \LaTeX, it's almost always best to use \verb+\includegraphics+, and to specify the figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the example below
{\small\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]
                   {myfile.pdf}
\end{verbatim}
}


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Color}

Please refer to the author guidelines on the \confName\ \confYear\ web page for a discussion of the use of color in your document.

If you use color in your plots, please keep in mind that a significant subset of reviewers and readers may have a color vision deficiency; red-green blindness is the most frequent kind.
Hence avoid relying only on color as the discriminative feature in plots (such as red \vs green lines), but add a second discriminative feature to ease disambiguation.
